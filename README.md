=====================
This is the organisers' interface for the Max Ent 2018.
Please navigate to max-ent.github.io for the website itself.

For organisers: Please note that you will need to clone the repo and then perform a commit in order to force GitHub to run Jekyll (the engine that actually builds the website). Editing through the browser doesn't seem to reliably call Jekyll.
